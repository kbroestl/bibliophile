%h1 About the Bibliophile Project

%p Data stored in here pertains to the personal library. The goal is currently only for paper books, including books on file (copies, in a file cabinet), to also have books that are no longer in the collection, books checked out from various libraries.

%p This page also contains information regarding to-do items, wish lists, etc.

%h2 Project History
%p It all started with a stack of books and a pad of paper, trying to answer the question, "Which of these books have I already read, what's still on the shelf unread?"

%p It became a Word doc. Then a spreadsheet. Then an Access database. It migrated to mysql. It's been written in three flavors of php (Procedural, OO, ZendFramework-based). And now it's in Rails.

%p Because of the nature of the project, data is spotty at best. When did we start keeping track of languages? Only when languages became important. Readings only happened very recently as well.

%h3 Technical Wish List
%ul
  %li Search, Search, Search -- Persistent throughout the application
  %li Fun with stats and maybe stats packages
  %li Play with Javascript libraries to generate pretty pie graphs from stats collected above. (z.B. percentage of books written in various languages... etc.)

%h3 Testing initiative
%p Testing continues (as of April 2019) to be horrible. We need to add fixture data to be able to test the find_by_sql calls, particularly from the books model. Data is well partitioned, and for the most part the data seems to be structured correctly, but we just don't have the fixture data for tests which we need.
