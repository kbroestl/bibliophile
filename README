== Bibliophile

Small project with the hope of sorting through all the books that I deal with. The ultimate question to answer
is: "Where is x" where x could be a standalone book, a short story, essay, or poem.

Also to incorporate multiple readings of all items with ratings, dates, and "review" writing capabilities.

"Bill of Material"-like capabilities: This story exists within this book.

Search by author includes role: Stanley Fish? I don't have any of his books, but he was a contributor to a few.

And so forth. Generally, a CRUD app on steroids.
