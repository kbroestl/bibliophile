#Bibliophile

##Please note: This is a pet project, hardly ever stable, and may or not be of any use to anyone other than the creator (and even that is up for debate). 

It's the first app I've done on Rails (starting back at Rails 1.0), it's been redone a few times, each with a different focus. Right now it's Rails3.

Small project with the hope of sorting through all the books that I deal with. The ultimate question to answer is: "Where is x" where x could be a standalone book, a short story, essay, or poem. Here's a short list of Features/To-Do items:

- Also to incorporate multiple readings of all items with ratings, dates, and "review" writing capabilities.
- "Bill of Material"-like capabilities: This story exists within this book. 
- Mapping of author/contributors to books: Roles include author, contributor, translator, editor
- Search by author includes role: Stanley Fish? I don't have any of his books, but he was a contributor to a few.
- Collect some of the general stats expected: How many books by a certain author? How many by a publishing house? How many are translations from various other languages?

And so forth. Generally, a CRUD app on steroids.
